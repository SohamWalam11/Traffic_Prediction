# Traffic_Prediction
Traffic Trend Analysis:

The dataset was analyzed for different regions based on user input.

Traffic trends were visualized in an increasing order, making it easier to identify patterns.

High traffic occurrences were detected and compared against the median traffic index.

Traffic Prediction using LSTM:

A deep learning model (LSTM) was trained on normalized traffic index data.

The model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) that indicate its performance in forecasting future traffic trends.

The RÂ² Score provided an accuracy measure, showing how well the predictions align with actual values.

Accident Risk Assessment:

Accident risk was computed using traffic index and pollution levels.

Different risk levels were visualized using color-coded scatter plots to highlight high-risk periods.

Morning and evening peak traffic times were identified as crucial factors contributing to accident-prone zones.
